# Integration with Notepad++

1. From the main menu, check under “Plugins” that you have the “Plugin Manager” installed. If not, install it by following this [instructions](https://bruderste.in/npp/pm/#install).

2. Go to “Plugins” > “Plugin Manager” > “Show Plugin Manager”. In the “Available” tab, search for “NppExec”, select it and click on “Install”.

3. Go to “Plugins” > “NppExec” > “Execute”. Type the command for the Control-M Automation API service you want to invoke, then save and assign a name as in the following screenshot (which shows an example for the "*build*" service):

   * Name : ```ctm_build```
   * Command : ```cmd /c ctm build "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"```
   
4. Repeat the last step to add any additional services - some examples:

   * Run jobs and monitor via Control-M Workbench : ```/c ctm run "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" -i -e workbench```
   * Deploy jobs to default Control-M environment : ```cmd /c ctm deploy "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"```
   
5. Go to “Plugins” > “NppExec” and make sure you have the options "Console Command History" and "No internal messages" selected.

6. Go to “Plugins” > “NppExec” > “Advanced Options” and select the “Place to the Macros submenu” option, and “[Console]” > “Visible (on start)” = “No”.

7. From the same window, select each "Associated script", type the "Item name" you want to show in the menus and click on “Add/Modify”. Repeat the same steps for any additional item you want to add to the menu.

   At this point, you can already access all these operations by clicking on “Macro” in the main menu.

8. If you want to add all these functions to a context menu (accessible via right-click on a file), go to “Settings” > “Edit Popup ContextMenu”. A new file is opened which contains the details for the appearance of the context menu.

   Go to any part of the file where you want to include your new sub-menu for Control-M Automation API, and add a line for each "Item name" defined before following the format shown in this example:
   
    ```
    <!--
    Control-M Automation API integration (via NppExec plugin)
    -->
    <Item FolderName="Control-M Automation API" PluginEntryName="NppExec" PluginCommandItemName="Build workflow" />
    <Item FolderName="Control-M Automation API" PluginEntryName="NppExec" PluginCommandItemName="Run workflow" />
    <Item FolderName="Control-M Automation API" PluginEntryName="NppExec" PluginCommandItemName="Deploy workflow" />
    <Item id="0"/>
    ```
   
   where:
   
   * ```FolderName``` is the name of the common sub-menu for Control-M Automation API
   * ```PluginCommandItemName``` corresponds to each "Item name" previously defined via NppExec
   * The lines ```<Item id="0"/>``` are menu separators

9. Restart Notepad++. You can now access any of the previously defined operations either via “Macro” in the main menu or by right clicking on a file. A console window will open at the bottom showing the results of the operation.

   *Integration tested with Notepad++ 7.5.9 (64-bit) and NppExec plugin 0.6 running on Windows 10*
