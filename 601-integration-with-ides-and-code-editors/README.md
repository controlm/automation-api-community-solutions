# Integration with IDEs and Code Editors

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) tools and code/text editors can be easily integrated with [Control-M Automation API Services](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/public/workloadautomation/Control-M+Automation+API+-+Services) via command line. This way, a developer can invoke functions such as *build*, *run*, *deploy*, etc for a JSON file containing Control-M “Jobs-as-Code” definitions – directly from his tool of choice.

This folder contains some examples of integrations with IDE tools and code/text editors. The same functionality can be achieved with any tool capable of launching external commands from its graphical interface.

For any of these sample integrations to work, the **Control-M Automation Command Line Interface (CLI)** must be installed on the same computer as the IDE tool or code/text editor, and configured for the required Control-M endpoint(s). For more details, please check the [Control-M Automation API Installation](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/public/workloadautomation/Control-M+Automation+API+-+Installation) documentation and look for "*Installing the Control-M Automation CLI*".
