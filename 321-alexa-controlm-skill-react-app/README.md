# Alexa Control-M Skill Configuration React App

This React app is part of an Alexa Skill for Control-M. It was commissioned by BMC Software (http://jobsascode.io) and written by BotsCrew (https://botscrew.com/)

The code for the Control-M Alexa Skill is available in (https://github.com/controlm/automation-api-community-solutions/tree/master/320-alexa-controlm-skill)

The app helps to overcome deficiencies in the current verbal support for technical terms that are not actual words. For example, if a Folder is called XBr3PT5, Alexa currently requires that you spell out such a term indicating upper or lower case for each character. To minimize the need for repetition, this app provides a means of configuring certain commonly occuring terms including:
* __Control-M Environment:__ You can pre-define environments such as Production or Test as the targets for your requests  
* __Default Folder:__ The Control-M folder to use as the source for jobs 
* __Default Job name:__ The default job on which you wish to operate on
