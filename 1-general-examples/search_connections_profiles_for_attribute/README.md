# Search connection profiles on agents for specific attributes

Company XYZ has a very dynamic network infrastructure where things change constantly.  Various hosts used for file transfers, SAP, Hadoop, web servers, and others get decommissioned or migrated frequently.  As a consequence, host names, file paths, logins, and other attributes may be changed in the process.  For the Control-M Administrator it is often a daunting task to figure out which agent and Control-M module will be affected.  The Control-M administrator wants a way to search specific attributes on connection profiles that changed and report on them, so he or she can update them.
