## Online Documentation
You can find the latest BMC Helix Control-M Automation API documentation, including the CLI installation guide, on the [**project web page**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/saas-api/control-m-saas-automation-api-home-941878993.html).

## Contribution guide
To contribute, please follow these guidelines.

### Files, folders and naming conventions
1. Every sample and its associated files must be contained in its own **folder**. Name this folder as something that describes what your sample does. Please clasify your sample, according you its purpose, using one of the existing directories.

      For consistent categorization, please comply to the following folder structure:
      + 1-general-examples
      + 2-external-monitoring-tools-examples
      
2. For consistent ordering **create all folders in lowercase**.

3. Include a **README.md** file that explains the example. A good description helps other community members to understand your example. The README.md uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting text. If you want to add images to your README.md file, store the images in the **images** folder. Reference the images in the README.md with a relative path (e.g. `![alt text](images/sampleImage.png "Sample Image Text")`). This ensures the link will reference the target repository if the source repository is forked.
