## Description

This shell script ([**alerts_json.sh**](alerts_json.sh)) converts the alert data to JSON, which can be useful when an external tool is expecting the input in such format.

As an example, the alert data is saved into a file, but this could be replaced by any other action (e.g. sending the alert data as a JSON payload via a webhook).

## Instructions

- If you use the script as it is (saving the JSON data into a file), update the **alerts_dir** and **alerts_file** variables with your custom file location.

- If you have modified the default JSON template for alerts (which determines the information to provide: alert fields, names and order of appearance - as documented in the [**Alerts Template reference**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/saas-api/alerts-template-reference-1144242602.html)), remember to update the **field_names** variable in the script with the corresponding field names and their order.

## Additional information

The alert data is passed as parameters to the script with the format `<field1>: <value1> <field2>: <value2> [...]`, as in the following example:

    eventType: I id: 2193 server: IN01 fileName: runId: 00q2e severity: V status: 0 time: 20221126150057 user: updateTime: message: Ended not OK runAs: ctmagent subApplication: application: my-demos jobName: my-sample-job host: zzz-linux-agent-1 type: R closedByControlM: ticketNumber: runNo: 00001 notes:
\
The script parses the input data and converts it to JSON format, starting with the "*alertFields*" key and followed by an array containing all the alert fields and their corresponding values - as in the example below. This is the same JSON structure as the one received when connecting to the External Alerts service via a WebSocket client.

    {
       "alertFields" : [
          {"eventType" : "I"},
          {"id" : "2193"},
          {"server" : "IN01"},
          {"fileName" : ""},
          {"runId" : "00q2e"},
          {"severity" : "V"},
          {"status" : "0"},
          {"time" : "20221126150057"},
          {"user" : ""},
          {"updateTime" : ""},
          {"message" : "Ended not OK"},
          {"runAs" : "ctmagent"},
          {"subApplication" : ""},
          {"application" : "my-demos"},
          {"jobName" : "my-sample-job"},
          {"host" : "zzz-linux-agent-1"},
          {"type" : "R"},
          {"closedByControlM" : ""},
          {"ticketNumber" : ""},
          {"runNo" : "00001"},
          {"notes" : ""}
        ]
    }
